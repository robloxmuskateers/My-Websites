    <p>I love reading adventure books like the Harry Potter series by J.K Rowling because they can take you to a whole new world when reading them, and you can get sucked in and read for hours without stopping. This particular book series is very interesting to me, and it gives you at least a month of reading. Once you finish one book, you can't wait to find out what happens in the next, and so you start rreading it again. I personally have read these books multiple times and I am still not bored of them. I highly suggest this series of books if you want a fun reading adventure!</p>
